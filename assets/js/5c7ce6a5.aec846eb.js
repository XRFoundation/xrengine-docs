A good comparison is Minecraft -- most Minecraft users playing on large social servers are connecting to a single endpoint that breaks them out into one of many smaller servers.

This makes it much harder for users to hack other users or generally hack a network that has no server authority.

In either case we can set heuristics to instance any given location if many people arrive. The bottleneck for most devices is how many skinned mesh avatars they can render at a time, and on the server it\'s how many WebRTC feeds we can pipe through.
